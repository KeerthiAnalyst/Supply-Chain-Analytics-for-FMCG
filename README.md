### Supply Chain Analytics Project
##### I improved supply chain performance at GDS Mart by developing key performance indicators and optimizing processes. This resulted in significant improvements in order fulfillment metrics and inventory management.

#### Implementation:
#### KPI Development and Implementation:
##### Created comprehensive KPIs to measure order fulfillment performance, such as Line Fill Rate (LIFR %) and Volume Fill Rate (VOFR %).

#### Process Optimization:
##### Improved Line Fill Rate (LIFR %) by 30% through detailed performance tracking and optimization.
##### Increased On-Time Delivery (OT %) by 20% through targeted process enhancements and better resource allocation.

#### Inventory Optimization and Demand Forecasting:
##### Surpassed In Full Delivery (IF %) targets by 15% with effective inventory management and demand forecasting.
##### Achieved On-Time In Full (OTIF %) targets consistently above 95% by fostering cross-functional collaboration and enhancing communication channels.
